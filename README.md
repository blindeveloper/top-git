**Core of this App**: Decided to go with create-react-app builder for saving time on tuning all in app configurations.

**Caching**: I tried to make this app fully covered with cache idea. This app should not request any data again if they were previously requested. + I tried to store to the cache only useful info

**Lazy loading**: I've decided to go with lazy loading and mobile first approach
